I AM WORKING ON AN UPDATE TO MAKE THIS COMPATIBLE WITH WPMU.  IF YOU HAVE WPMU INSTALLED DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS PLUGIN UNTIL THIS MESSAGE GOES AWAY.  Tthis plugin is for BuddyPress and allows you to manually activate users who have not activated their account via the email link.  This can be used if the email doesn't get to the user for any reason...ie spam filtering, email host etc.  It places a menu in the Users menu in the wp-admin area of your blog.
